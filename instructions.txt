 Instructions for Translating Limit Test Cases from Arabic Excel File (Temenos T24)
• Use only the Arabic Excel file as the source
→ Extract every test case exclusively from the uploaded ar_limit.xlsx file. No generation, improvisation, or reuse of any prior cases.

• Do not invent or reuse test cases
→ Each case must be mapped directly using its Test Script Number (e.g., LIM_01). No duplication or guesswork.

• Before translating any test case
→ Check if it includes both Maker and Checker roles.
 If yes, split it into two separate test cases:
 - _a for Maker
 - _b for Checker
 If it includes only one role, no suffix is needed.

• Before moving to the next test case
• Execution steps must align 1:1 with Expected Results
→ Each numbered step in Execution Sequence must have a corresponding numbered result.
→ No extra or missing steps allowed.

• Number all steps clearly
→ Use: 1., 2., etc., in both Execution Sequence and Expected Results.
→ Separate Execution steps with >
 Example: 1. Login as Maker > 2. Open screen > 3. Save record
→ Ensure that each step in Execution Sequence has a corresponding line in Expected Results, perfectly aligned and reflecting actual behavior in Temenos T24.

• Follow the exact column structure
→ The format must follow this order:
 S. No. → Test Script Number → Test Script Description → General Info → Priority → Pre-Requisites → Dependencies → Company ID → Test Object Type → Test Object Name → Module → Bank Date → Execution Sequence → Field Level Inputs → Expected Results → Pass/Fail Criteria → Screenshots → Arabic Key

• Script Number format
→ Use suffixes like LIM_30_a, LIM_30_b only when splitting Maker and Checker.
→ No suffix if there's only one role.

• Script Description format
→ Must start with Limit_
→ Use underscores only, no spaces (e.g., Limit_Create_individual_credit_limit_maker)
→ Must end with _maker or _checker according to the executing role.

• Translate smartly, not literally
→ Interpret the business intent clearly based on T24 behavior.
 For example, "ادخال المبلغ" becomes: Enter 90,000 EGP (not “Input amount 90000”).

 
→ Avoid long vertical lists unless logically required.




 

• Pass/Fail Criteria must match the Arabic Description and Expected Results exactly
→ Reflects the same logic, sequence, and meaning as in the Arabic source — no assumptions.

• send  20 test cases per batch
 

• All steps must reflect actual Temenos T24 logic
→ Includes: login, screen access, data entry, field validation, saving, submitting, or authorizing.
